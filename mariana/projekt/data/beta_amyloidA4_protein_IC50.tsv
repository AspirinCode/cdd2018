The cells are plated at a density of 8000 cells/well into 96-well microtiter plates and cultivated for 24 hours in DMEM cell culture medium containing 10% FCS. The test compound is added to the cells at various concentrations, and the cells are cultivated for 24 hours in the presence of the test compound. The supernatants are collected, and the concentration of amyloid peptide 1-40 is determined using state of the art immunoassay techniques, for example sandwich ELISA, homogenous time-resolved fluorescence (HTRF) immunoassay, or electro-chemiluminescence immunoassay. The potency of the compound is calculated from the percentage of inhibition of amyloid peptide release as a function of the test compound concentration.	37	BindingDB Database	Homo sapiens			Autocuration	BAO_0000219	10656	CHEMBL2487	SINGLE PROTEIN	P05067	Beta amyloid A4 protein	Homo sapiens	8	Homologous protein			102554	CHEMBL3886169			2015

To these amyloid beta peptide, amyloid beta peptide aggregates that had been prepared in advance by the same method and sonicated for 30 minutes under 28-45-100 KHz variation were added by a 1/1000 quantity, whereby uniform amyloid beta peptide aggregates were prepared.The amyloid beta peptide aggregates prepared by the above method, thioflavin-T, and a measurement compound were added in a 50 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) such that the final concentrations thereof were 1 uM, 3 uM, and 0.02 to 20 uM, respectively. The resultant solution was cause to react for 30 minutes at 23 C. with the light shielded.	37	BindingDB Database	Homo sapiens		9606	Autocuration	BAO_0000357	10656	CHEMBL2487	SINGLE PROTEIN	P05067	Beta amyloid A4 protein	Homo sapiens	9	Protein			94697	CHEMBL3638565			2015

The cells are plated at a density of 8000 cells/well into 96-well microtiter plates and cultivated for 24 hours in DMEM cell culture medium containing 10% FCS. The test compound is added to the cells at various concentrations, and the cells are cultivated for 24 hours in the presence of the test compound. The supernatants are collected, and the concentration of amyloid peptide 1-40 is determined using state of the art immunoassay techniques, for example sandwich ELISA, homogenous time-resolved fluorescence (HTRF) immunoassay, or electro-chemiluminescence immunoassay. The potency of the compound is calculated from the percentage of inhibition of amyloid peptide release as a function of the test compound concentration.	37	BindingDB Database	Homo sapiens			Autocuration	BAO_0000219	10656	CHEMBL2487	SINGLE PROTEIN	P05067	Beta amyloid A4 protein	Homo sapiens	8	Homologous protein			102554	CHEMBL3886169			2015

Nat'l Acad. Sci. USA 97:6183-643, incorporated herein by reference. Briefly, recombinant peptide substrate was incubated with γ-secretase (40 μg/ml) in the presence or absence of test compound. The reaction mixture contained 0.25% CHAPSO, 0.1 μg/μl BSA, protease inhibitor, 50 mM PIPES, pH 7.0, 5 mM MgCl2, 5 mM CaCl2 and 150 mM KCl. The reaction was incubated for 2.5 hr at 37° C. and stopped by adding RIPA buffer (150 mM NaCl, 1.0% NP-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 50 mM Tris HCl, pH 8.0). The products were detected with various antibody combinations using electrochemiluminescence (ECL) technology as previously described in Li et al., 2000, Proc. Nat'l Acad. Sci. USA 97:6183-643; Lai et al., 2003, J. Biol. Chem. 278: 22475-22481; and Yin et al., 2007, J. Biol.

The cells are plated at a density of 8000 cells/well into 96-well microtiter plates and cultivated for 24 hours in DMEM cell culture medium containing 10% FCS. The test compound is added to the cells at various concentrations, and the cells are cultivated for 24 hours in the presence of the test compound. The supernatants are collected, and the concentration of amyloid peptide 1-40 is determined using state of the art immunoassay techniques, for example sandwich ELISA, homogenous time-resolved fluorescence (HTRF) immunoassay, or electro-chemiluminescence immunoassay. The potency of the compound is calculated from the percentage of inhibition of amyloid peptide release as a function of the test compound concentration.	37	BindingDB Database	Homo sapiens			Autocuration	BAO_0000219	10656	CHEMBL2487	SINGLE PROTEIN	P05067	Beta amyloid A4 protein	Homo sapiens	8	Homologous protein			102554	CHEMBL3886169			2015

The cells are plated at a density of 8000 cells/well into 96-well microtiter plates and cultivated for 24 hours in DMEM cell culture medium containing 10% FCS. The test compound is added to the cells at various concentrations, and the cells are cultivated for 24 hours in the presence of the test compound. The supernatants are collected, and the concentration of amyloid peptide 1-40 is determined using state of the art immunoassay techniques, for example sandwich ELISA, homogenous time-resolved fluorescence (HTRF) immunoassay, or electro-chemiluminescence immunoassay. The potency of the compound is calculated from the percentage of inhibition of amyloid peptide release as a function of the test compound concentration.	37	BindingDB Database	Homo sapiens			Autocuration	BAO_0000219	10656	CHEMBL2487	SINGLE PROTEIN	P05067	Beta amyloid A4 protein	Homo sapiens	8	Homologous protein			102554	CHEMBL3886169			2015

The cells are plated at a density of 8000 cells/well into 96-well microtiter plates and cultivated for 24 hours in DMEM cell culture medium containing 10% FCS. The test compound is added to the cells at various concentrations, and the cells are cultivated for 24 hours in the presence of the test compound. The supernatants are collected, and the concentration of amyloid peptide 1-40 is determined using state of the art immunoassay techniques, for example sandwich ELISA, homogenous time-resolved fluorescence (HTRF) immunoassay, or electro-chemiluminescence immunoassay. The potency of the compound is calculated from the percentage of inhibition of amyloid peptide release as a function of the test compound concentration.	37	BindingDB Database	Homo sapiens			Autocuration	BAO_0000219	10656	CHEMBL2487	SINGLE PROTEIN	P05067	Beta amyloid A4 protein	Homo sapiens	8	Homologous protein			102554	CHEMBL3886169			2015

Nat'l Acad. Sci. USA 97:6183-643, incorporated herein by reference. Briefly, recombinant peptide substrate was incubated with γ-secretase (40 μg/ml) in the presence or absence of test compound. The reaction mixture contained 0.25% CHAPSO, 0.1 μg/μl BSA, protease inhibitor, 50 mM PIPES, pH 7.0, 5 mM MgCl2, 5 mM CaCl2 and 150 mM KCl. The reaction was incubated for 2.5 hr at 37° C. and stopped by adding RIPA buffer (150 mM NaCl, 1.0% NP-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 50 mM Tris HCl, pH 8.0). The products were detected with various antibody combinations using electrochemiluminescence (ECL) technology as previously described in Li et al., 2000, Proc. Nat'l Acad. Sci. USA 97:6183-643; Lai et al., 2003, J. Biol. Chem. 278: 22475-22481; and Yin et al., 2007, J. Biol.

The cells are plated at a density of 8000 cells/well into 96-well microtiter plates and cultivated for 24 hours in DMEM cell culture medium containing 10% FCS. The test compound is added to the cells at various concentrations, and the cells are cultivated for 24 hours in the presence of the test compound. The supernatants are collected, and the concentration of amyloid peptide 1-40 is determined using state of the art immunoassay techniques, for example sandwich ELISA, homogenous time-resolved fluorescence (HTRF) immunoassay, or electro-chemiluminescence immunoassay. The potency of the compound is calculated from the percentage of inhibition of amyloid peptide release as a function of the test compound concentration.	37	BindingDB Database	Homo sapiens			Autocuration	BAO_0000219	10656	CHEMBL2487	SINGLE PROTEIN	P05067	Beta amyloid A4 protein	Homo sapiens	8	Homologous protein			102554	CHEMBL3886169			2015

Nat'l Acad. Sci. USA 97:6183-643, incorporated herein by reference. Briefly, recombinant peptide substrate was incubated with γ-secretase (40 μg/ml) in the presence or absence of test compound. The reaction mixture contained 0.25% CHAPSO, 0.1 μg/μl BSA, protease inhibitor, 50 mM PIPES, pH 7.0, 5 mM MgCl2, 5 mM CaCl2 and 150 mM KCl. The reaction was incubated for 2.5 hr at 37° C. and stopped by adding RIPA buffer (150 mM NaCl, 1.0% NP-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 50 mM Tris HCl, pH 8.0). The products were detected with various antibody combinations using electrochemiluminescence (ECL) technology as previously described in Li et al., 2000, Proc. Nat'l Acad. Sci. USA 97:6183-643; Lai et al., 2003, J. Biol. Chem. 278: 22475-22481; and Yin et al., 2007, J. Biol.

The cells are plated at a density of 8000 cells/well into 96-well microtiter plates and cultivated for 24 hours in DMEM cell culture medium containing 10% FCS. The test compound is added to the cells at various concentrations, and the cells are cultivated for 24 hours in the presence of the test compound. The supernatants are collected, and the concentration of amyloid peptide 1-40 is determined using state of the art immunoassay techniques, for example sandwich ELISA, homogenous time-resolved fluorescence (HTRF) immunoassay, or electro-chemiluminescence immunoassay. The potency of the compound is calculated from the percentage of inhibition of amyloid peptide release as a function of the test compound concentration.	37	BindingDB Database	Homo sapiens			Autocuration	BAO_0000219	10656	CHEMBL2487	SINGLE PROTEIN	P05067	Beta amyloid A4 protein	Homo sapiens	8	Homologous protein			102554	CHEMBL3886169			2015

The cells are plated at a density of 8000 cells/well into 96-well microtiter plates and cultivated for 24 hours in DMEM cell culture medium containing 10% FCS. The test compound is added to the cells at various concentrations, and the cells are cultivated for 24 hours in the presence of the test compound. The supernatants are collected, and the concentration of amyloid peptide 1-40 is determined using state of the art immunoassay techniques, for example sandwich ELISA, homogenous time-resolved fluorescence (HTRF) immunoassay, or electro-chemiluminescence immunoassay. The potency of the compound is calculated from the percentage of inhibition of amyloid peptide release as a function of the test compound concentration.	37	BindingDB Database	Homo sapiens			Autocuration	BAO_0000219	10656	CHEMBL2487	SINGLE PROTEIN	P05067	Beta amyloid A4 protein	Homo sapiens	8	Homologous protein			102554	CHEMBL3886169			2015

Nat'l Acad. Sci. USA 97:6183-643, incorporated herein by reference. Briefly, recombinant peptide substrate was incubated with γ-secretase (40 μg/ml) in the presence or absence of test compound. The reaction mixture contained 0.25% CHAPSO, 0.1 μg/μl BSA, protease inhibitor, 50 mM PIPES, pH 7.0, 5 mM MgCl2, 5 mM CaCl2 and 150 mM KCl. The reaction was incubated for 2.5 hr at 37° C. and stopped by adding RIPA buffer (150 mM NaCl, 1.0% NP-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 50 mM Tris HCl, pH 8.0). The products were detected with various antibody combinations using electrochemiluminescence (ECL) technology as previously described in Li et al., 2000, Proc. Nat'l Acad. Sci. USA 97:6183-643; Lai et al., 2003, J. Biol. Chem. 278: 22475-22481; and Yin et al., 2007, J. Biol.

The cells are plated at a density of 8000 cells/well into 96-well microtiter plates and cultivated for 24 hours in DMEM cell culture medium containing 10% FCS. The test compound is added to the cells at various concentrations, and the cells are cultivated for 24 hours in the presence of the test compound. The supernatants are collected, and the concentration of amyloid peptide 1-40 is determined using state of the art immunoassay techniques, for example sandwich ELISA, homogenous time-resolved fluorescence (HTRF) immunoassay, or electro-chemiluminescence immunoassay. The potency of the compound is calculated from the percentage of inhibition of amyloid peptide release as a function of the test compound concentration.	37	BindingDB Database	Homo sapiens			Autocuration	BAO_0000219	10656	CHEMBL2487	SINGLE PROTEIN	P05067	Beta amyloid A4 protein	Homo sapiens	8	Homologous protein			102554	CHEMBL3886169			2015
